# MedicarePaymentProbability
This file aims to calculate the probability that Medicare will pay at least 50% of the total submitted medical bill using Python. From a dataset that contained information about 20 clinics: the number of Medicare beneficiaries, the total submitted charge amount, and the total Medicare allowed amount; I calculated the total submitted charge amount per person, by dividing the total submitted charge amount by the number of Medicare beneficiaries per clinic; as well as, I calculated the total Medicare allowed amount per person, by dividing the total Medicare allowed amount by the number of Medicare beneficiaries. By dividing the total Medicare allowed amount per person by the total submitted charge amount per person; I got the ratio of allowed payment by the total submitted bill per person that would aim to predict the probability of Medicare paying at least half of a person bill. 
From the ratio of allowed payment by the total submitted bill per person dataset, I created a python program that helped me develop a neural network algorithm that led me to the desired output (probability of the event). I assigned a 0 if the dataset item did not meet at least 0.5 of the ratios, and 1 if it did meet the ratiosâ€™ value or higher. I used the neural network architecture to set input and hidden values that would filter the data and provide a desired output value. The desired output was from a sigmoid function that calculated the probability of that Medicare will pay at least 50% of the total submitted medical bill based on the dataset provided.
